Note you may need to complete an MFA step in the browser before you can generate a bot token. 

## Setup

You may want to fork it first

`git clone https://github.com/danielzting/clearurls-discord-bot.git`

or 

`gh repo clone danielzting/clearurls-discord-bot`

Having installed `python`, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies 

`python -m venv .`

Activate the environment with `scripts\activate` (Windows) or `source bin\activate` (Linux).

Then install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project structure 

The [unalix](https://github.com/AmanoTeam/Unalix/tree/master/unalix) library is archived. Its source is included in this project in the `unalix` folder.

The `data.min.json` file is sourced from [https://docs.clearurls.xyz/latest/specs/rules/](https://docs.clearurls.xyz/latest/specs/rules/) because the version provided by Unalix was outdated. Pull requests to update this file and keep it in sync with the official ClearURLs ruleset are welcome!

The bot itself is in `main.py`.

The bot uses a couple sqlite tables to persist data. Functions to initialize and interact with the database are in the `database` folder.

`guildsettings.py` is for Discord server specific settings. Currently we use a small lookup table to store that flag.

`auditlog.py` is used to store a log of messages deleted by the bot within the last 2 weeks, for guilds that have enabled the auto-delete feature. These user ids are retained for the purposes of verifying that a user reacting with the trashcan emoji to delete the bot's post is the same person whose message was moderated.

`util.py` has a function for getting a sqlite db connection with some flags that enable better support for timestamps.
